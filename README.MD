## Notes

I cant get the charts to work. I tried using Chart.js and Google Charts but I couldn't get them to work. I also tried using the data from the API but I couldn't get that to work either. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.

also have a hard time passing state between components. I'm could not figure out how to pass the state and data from the Search results component to the dashboard spent 7 hours on this.
