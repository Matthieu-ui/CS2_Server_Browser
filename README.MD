# NERV

## What is NERV?

NERV is a full stack web application template using Node.js, Express, React, and Vite (NERV). Along with Tailwind CSS, it also includes a few other libraries to help you get started.

## Why NERV?

I built NERV to help me get started with new projects. I wanted to have a template that I could use to quickly get a project up and running. I also wanted to use the latest and greatest technologies. I hope you find it useful.
